 *                keeps it open, so a browser without the script shows it as before; the script closes it on a narrow
 *                screen and remembers the reader's choice.
 *
 * The CSS for both lives in public/css/tips.css; the rule that shows the picked block is written for the page,
 * because there is one per block.
